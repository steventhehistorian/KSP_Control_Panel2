# KSP_Control_Panel
A platform for creating an Arduino-driven real-world physical control panel for Kerbal Space Program.  
**This package allows you to:**  
1. Automatically retrieve vessel/flight surface and orbit data from KSP using the Python krpc package and output via an Arduino to common I<sup>2</sup>C peripherals, such as LCD's and OLED's, etc. \n 
2. Send control instructions to and/or execute code on KSP from custom built control devices such as...well...whatever you cobble together from the mess of components on your project bench...
